I am going to start to write my personal journal with this blog post. I am not going to publish it but anyway it will be saved in here. I might start with the day before today, which is sunday jun 19th. I spent some time at home and attend a funeral of my friend's father. it was my first experience.. and as a following i am going to the ceremony that he will be buried. he is a veteran so it will be a military ceremony. yesterday, i also attended a presentation by one of the full proffosers in the community.
by the way, my first paper will be published! it is the one that we wrote with our asacad group. although i could not contribute much, still they involved me.

Lets make it a starter and write may be in more details in my daily life so i can get the momentum to continue to write my dissertation!!!

on that spesific day, okay i was about to delete but then remember what murat hoca said about freewriting. he saide just write even if it nonsense, do not delete.
let move to the new post to write about the new day!

i may read these posts later and may add or subtract some things.

(i could not keep myself without deleting:/ )
